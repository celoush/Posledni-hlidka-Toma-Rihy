DIARY:
-----------------------------
These are tough times. Chedaky are attacking government soldiers all the time, so they prefer to stay in coastal regions and they don't care much about the inland areas. Furthermore the Chedaky concentrate them selves more and more in our area and therefore skirmishes are daily bread. Unfortunately, local people are aware of that and they try to avoid any contact with us, because they are afraid of chedaky revenge. So we decided to change our message delivery system. Now we leave messages in specific hideouts. We are increasing our activity now and we forced chedaky not to show them selves up on the roads and in the villages. At least not as often as they did few weeks ago. But thougher fights await us. Firefights between ours and chedaky patrols happen often than ever before.
A long patrol awaits us tonight plus we need to change our position. Earlier today was one of the HQ's contact supposed to deliver a message to the hideout on hill Dubina. We have to find that message and get done anything it says. Then we have to reach another checkpoint, which is an old abandoned barn, where we'll leave message for HQ right after we finish our tasks. Unless the message says otherwise, we will stick to the plan and move to an old military base near Dubrovka. Our task there is to attack chedaky forces and make them split their forces. Let's hope the situation will change soon, because we won't last for long if it goes on like this.
We hid some creates with ammunition in this area, so we can use them if we'll need more ammo.
We should also check certain places for messages from local people.
